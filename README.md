# Snake Project

## Description

This is a simple snake game made in C using the ncurses library.
It has been developed by me as a project to learn more about C programming. It is my first project in C, so it may not be perfect, but I am happy with the result.

## How to play

To play the game, you need to have the ncurses library installed on your system.
You can install it by running the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev
```

After that, you can compile the game by running the following command:

```bash
make
```

And then you can run the game by running the following command:

```bash
./snake
```

To move the snake, you can use the arrow keys. The goal is to eat the food that appears on the screen and grow the snake as much as possible. If the snake collides with the walls or itself, the game is over. You win when you reach 100 points.
